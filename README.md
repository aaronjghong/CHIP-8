# CHIP-8 Emulator

I've been wanting to get into emulation and to practice my programming. I figured that I'd start with the "Hello World" of emulators by working on a CHIP-8 emulator made in C++

## What's been done:

-   "Hardware"
-   Programming Opcode Functions
-   Fixing Opcode bugs
-   Basic SDL implementation
-   Input
-   Better Update Rate

## What's left to be done:

-   Sound
-   External .ini Reading for settings/rom

## If you would like to make a CHIP-8 emulator too, I highly recommend the following resources:
