# CHIP-8 Emulator

I've been wanting to get into emulation and to practice my programming. I figured that I'd start with the "Hello World" of emulators by working on a CHIP-8 emulator made in C++

The project is for Windows Only, however, could be ported over to other systems by removing winuser.h and windows.h and re-implementing the error messages in main.cpp

## What's been done:

-   "Hardware"
-   Programming Opcode Functions
-   Fixing Opcode bugs
-   Basic SDL implementation
-   Input
-   Better Update Rate
-   Reading from external settings file
-   Sound ( _Note: Implementation is not the best_ )
